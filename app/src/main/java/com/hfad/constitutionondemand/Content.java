The Virginia Declaration of Rights is considered the first legislation to call for a free press and greatly influenced the Bill of Rights.  Similarly, the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom introduced the concept of separation of church and state and the concept of freedom of conscience, both concepts influenced the concept of freedom of religion found in the 1st Amendment to the constitution.<br>" +

                    "History:  Beginning in 1774, the Continental Congress acted as the provisional government of the newly formed United States.  The Continental Congress drafted the first constitution of the United States, known as the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union in little over a years time starting in mid-1776 and completing in late 1777.  Ratification of the first constitution was not achieved until 1781.  This first attempt at a constitution failed to provide adequate governance over the United States.  Under the Articles of Confederation the government was unable to collect sufficient taxes to fund itself and while it could print money, the newly printed funds were worthless.  Without funding, the United States was unable to provide an adequate defense and the weakness of the federal government failed to unite the states.  In May of 1787 it was proposed that a new constitution was needed and eventually 12 states named delegates who began the task of crating a new constitution. The creation and ratification of the Constitution faced significant hurdles, not the least of these was the significant divide in economic interests that existed between the industrial north and agrarian south.  Leaders from the south like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington garnered their wealth from crops raised by African slaves. Jefferson in particular, believed that the success of the United States must spring from an agrarian economy and that a powerful federal government posed a threat to that economy. By favoring state rights over federal rights, Jefferson and Washington believed that the ownership of slaves would continue and the success of the country would be assured.  In contrast, the economy of the northern United States did not need to rely on farming and was able to focus on manufacturing because of readily available sources of water power. With naturally occurring sources of power for their factories, owners did not need a large labor force to be profitable. Thus, the United States and its Constitution was conceived to unite states that shared opposing views of slavery. On September 13, 1788, the Constitution had been ratified by more than enough states and became the framework for new government. The new Constitution left the country divided roughly into an equal number of slave and free states and a balance of power prevailed in the government throughout the 18th and half of the 19th century."),

                    "Case Description:  In the U.S Presidential election of 1800, John Adams lost reelection to Thomas Jefferson.  Just two days before the end of Adams term in 1801, Adams nominated nearly 60 federal judges to fill positions that had been created by the Judiciary Act of 1801.  All of the appointees were strong supporters of the Federalist Party and Adam's action was taken primarily to stack the courts in favor of the Federalists.   The U.S. Senate confirmed Adam's appointments and all that was left was for the commissions to be served.  Unfortunately for Adams, several of the commissions, including one for William Marbury, were not delivered prior to the end of Adams term on March 3rd, 1801.  Upon taking office, Jefferson ordered his new Secretary of State, James Madison, to withhold any commissions that had not been delivered.  Jefferson took this action based on his belief that any of the undelivered commissions were void.  In December of 1801, William Marbury filed a U.S. Supreme Court suit against Madison which asked the court to issue a \"writ of mandamus\" which would force Madison to deliver his commission.  <br><br>" +
                    "Decision:  On February 24, 1803, the Court held that it could not compel Madison to deliver the commission to Marbury but in so doing, they established that the United States Constitution is actual law and that the Supreme Court had the power to strike down laws that they find to violate the Constitution.  The Courts's opinion was written by the Chief Justice John Marshall and was presented as an answer to three questions:<br>-First, did Marbury have a right to his commission?  The Court answered that Marbury did have a right to his commission<br>-Second, if Marbury had a right to his commission, was there a legal remedy for him to obtain it?  The court ruled that Marbury could obtain his commission by suit or action of law so he did have legal remedy.<br>-Third, if there was such a remedy, could the Supreme Court legally issue it?  Here the court ruled against Marbury as it found that the Supreme court did not have jurisdiction in the case. The court found that Congress had overstepped it's authority, when it passed the Judiciary Act of 1789, since the Act increased the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court beyond what was originally defined by the Constitution.  In coming to this decision, the Supreme Court established the Courts power of judicial review over Congress and perhaps more importantly, established the United States Constitution as a binding legal document which defines the boundaries between the Executive and Judicial branches of government.  Justice Marshall ruled that Congress cannot increase the Supreme Court's jurisdiction as defined in the Constitution and struck down the relevant portion of Section 13 of the Judiciary Act.  This action was the first time that the United States Supreme Court exercised the power of judicial review.  <br><br>" +
                    "Highlights of Majority Opinion:  In answering the First question the court stated that \"It is therefore decidedly the opinion of the court, that when a commission has been signed by the President, the appointment is made; and that the commission is complete, when the seal of the United States has been affixed to it by the Secretary of State.\"<br>" +

That by signing the commission of Mr. Marbury, the president of the United States appointed him a justice of peace, for the county of Washington in the district of Columbia; and that the seal of the United States, affixed thereto by the secretary of state, is conclusive testimony of the verity of the signature, and of the completion of the appointment; and that the appointment conferred on him a legal right to the office for the space of five years.<br>" +

                    "Finally, in answering the third question, the court exercised the power of judicial review by stating \"Thus, the particular phraseology of the constitution of the United States confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential to all written constitutions, that a law repugnant to the constitution is void;  and that courts, as well as other departments, are bound by that instrument." +

                    "Case Description:  McCollock v. Maryland is considered a landmark case since it established the powers of Congress as they relate to the States.  The question put before the court in the case of McColloch v Maryland, was to decide if the State of Maryland had the right to tax the Second Bank of the United States.  The State of Maryland, as part of a concerted effort by the states to limit the ability of the Federal Government to create a Federal Banking system, created a law that levied a large tax on any banks that operated in Maryland but were not chartered in the State of Maryland.  The fact that the Second Bank of the United States was the only bank in Maryland that was operating without a charter in Maryland greatly influenced the outcome of the case.<br><br>" +
                    "Decision:  The court ruled that Congress had the power to create a National Bank and that the State of Maryland had no right to interfere.  In making this decision, the Supreme Court found that the \"Necessary and Proper\" clause of the United States Constitution gave the Congress the right to create a banking system.  The court ruled that despite the fact that a banking system was not expressly enumerated in the Constitution, the Constitution did empower the Congress to form a Federal Government and that a banking system was a natural consequence of forming that Government.  The decision elevated the powers of Congress so as to assure the Federal Government's supremacy over that of the States.  As a result, the ability of States to block Federal law is limited since State action can never impede the Constitutionally granted power of Congress to create a comprehensive government. <br><br>" +
                    "Highlights of Majority Opinion:  The Court has bestowed on this subject its most deliberate consideration. The result is a conviction that the States have no power, by taxation or otherwise, to retard, impede, burden, or in any manner control the operations of the constitutional laws enacted by Congress to carry into execution the powers vested in the General Government. This is, we think, the unavoidable consequence of that supremacy which the Constitution has declared.\n" +

It does not extend to a tax paid by the real property of the bank, in common with the other real property within the State, nor to a tax imposed on the interest which the citizens of Maryland may hold in this institution, in common with other property of the same description throughout the State. But this is a tax on the operations of the bank, and is, consequently, a tax on the operation of an instrument employed by the Government of the Union to carry its powers into execution.

It has been included here to provide historical perspective and to illustrate the national divide that existed over slavery in 1857.<br>" +
                    "The question before the U.S. Supreme court was whether Dred Scott, an enslaved black man, who was moved from a slave state to a free state, was automatically freed, and was no longer legally a slave.  Dred Scott had been taken from the slave-holding state, Missouri, to the Missouri Territory, which had been designated as a free territory by the Missouri Compromise.  While in the Missouri Territory, Scott's owner leased the services of Scott and his wife out for profit.  The leasing of Scott and his wife's services for profit constituted slavery in a free state and was in direct violation of the Missouri Compromise.  Scott attempted to purchase his and his families freedom, but his owner refused and Scott then choose to pursue legal action.  After both the Missouri state court and the U.S. Federal court ruled that Scott was still a slave under state law, Scott appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court. <br><br>" +
                    "Decision:  When the case of Dred Scott v Sanford was presented to the Supreme Court, a significant pro-slavery bias existed in the court.  Starting with the Presidency of Andrew Jackson in 1836 and continuing with other like-minded presidents, new Supreme Court justices were appointed that leaned in favor of States Rights and Slavery. So, when in 1857, the Supreme Court began consideration of Dred Scott v. Sanford, the bias of the court, was a significant factor in the formation of the majority opinion.  Chief Justice Roger Taney, wrote the majority opinion and found that the United States Constitution was not meant to include American citizenship for black people and therefore the rights and privileges it confers upon American citizens could not apply to them.   By ruling that black people are not American citizens it followed that any lawsuit filed by a black person like Scott would automatically fail since the court had no jurisdiction over a case for non-citizens.  The courts ruling continued further and struck down the limitation of slavery contained in the Missouri Compromise, finding that it exceeded the powers of Congress granted to it under the Constitution.  Justice Taney and justices who ruled in agreement, hoped that the ruling would permanently settle the slavery controversy.  The ruling had the opposite effect and is believed to have been a significant factor in the outbreak of the American Civil War. <br><br>" +

It does not allege that the plaintiff had his domicile in any other State, nor that he is not a free man in Missouri. He is averred to have had a negro ancestry, but this does not show that he is not a citizen of Missouri, within the meaning of the act of Congress authorizing him to sue in the Circuit Court. It has never been held necessary, to constitute a citizen within the act, that he should have the qualifications of an elector.

                    "Case Description:  The Supreme Court's first case to establish the modern understanding of the First Amendment right to freedom of speech was Schenck v. United States.  When the case of  Schenck v. United States was brought before the Supreme Court in 1919, the United States had been at war with Germany for almost two years.  The First World War with Germany had caused deep divisions in United States society and several groups had emerged that vehemently opposed the United States involvement.  The members of the Socialist Party in Philadelphia opposed the United States involvement in the First World War and sought to discourage the enlistment of troops.  As the General Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Socialist Party, Charles Schenck oversaw the printing and mailing of more than 15,000 fliers to men who were facing the draft.  The fliers encouraged the men to not comply with the draft based on the claim that conscription constituted involuntary servitude and was in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment.  In response to acts of dissent such as resistance to the draft, the Wilson administration sought to block Charles Schenck and other opposition leaders.  Charles Schenck was charged and convicted of violation of Section 3 of the Espionage Act of 1917 in a lower federal court.<br><br>" +
                    "Decision:  The court held that Schenck's criminal conviction was constitutional.  Despite the fact that the statute only applied to successful obstructions of the draft, the common-law precedents allowed the prosecution for attempts that were nearly successful.  The Court found that the First Amendment did not protect speech encouraging men to resist induction into the military during a time of war.  The Court stated that free speech that would be allowed during peacetime was not protected during time of war because of the presence of new and greater dangers.<br><br>" +

A class action lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court on behalf of the Browns and twelve other local black families.  The U.S. District Court of Kansas ruled against the Browns and cited the Supreme Court's 1896 decision in Plessy v. Ferguson in which the court found that racial segregation was not a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.  The case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court by NAACP chief counsel Thurgood Marshall.  In addition to the Brown case, the NAACP sponsored four other similar cases from other locations.

The ruling was a major step forward for the Civil Rights Movement since it eventually resulted in the desegregation of all public American schools.  The ruling was met with significant resistance from the political leaders of Southern States who quickly found ways to frustrate any attempts to integrate schools.  Senator Harry F. Byrd, from Virginia, devised a plan known as \"Massive Resistance\" that he hoped would counter attempts to desegregate the Virginia school systems.  Four years later the Court reaffirmed the ruling on Brown in the case of Cooper v. Aaron.  In the case the Court found that state officials and legislators had no power to nullify the Brown v. Board of Eduction decision, but even this action was not enough to totally end segregation in Virginia.  Some level of segregation continued in Virginia until the court, driven by their impatience with Virginia's slow pace of school integration, choose to hear the case of Green V. School Board of New Kent County.  Building on the cases of Brown and Cooper, the court delivered a decision that took a new approach to the segregation issue.  The court ruled that it was not sufficient for school districts to just make token efforts towards compliance with segregation, the ruling instructed school districts \"to ensure racial balance in schools\".  The Court's insistence on the immediate destruction of segregated schools \"root and branch\" finally brought about substantive change in southern schools and by the the early 1970s the majority of black students were attending integrated schools.<br><br>" +

Compulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education to our democratic society. It is required in the performance of our most basic public responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principal instrument in awakening the child to cultural values, in preparing him for later professional training, and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity, where the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal terms. <br>" +

When Gideon appeared in court without representation, as he was too poor to afford council, he requested that the court appoint council.  Since Florida law only allowed the court to appoint council when the defendant was charged with a capital offense, the court refused Gideon's request.

While in prison Gideon petitioned the Florida Supreme Court, claiming that his Sixth Amendment right had been violated because the judge refused to appoint council.  After the Florida supreme Court denied Gideon's petition, Gideon appealed his case to the U.S. Supreme Court in a suit against the Secretary of the Florida Department of Corrections.

Jusitce Black continued that \"Not only these precedents but also reason and reflection require us to recognize that in our adversary system of criminal justice, any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him. This seems to us to be an obvious truth. Governments, both state and federal, quite properly spend vast sums of money to establish machinery to try defendants accused of crime. Lawyers to prosecute are everywhere deemed essential to protect the public's interest in an orderly society. Similarly, there are few defendants charged with crime, few indeed, who fail to hire the best lawyers they can get to prepare and present their defenses. That government hires lawyers to prosecute and defendants who have the money hire lawyers to defend are the strongest indications of the widespread belief that lawyers in criminal courts are necessities, not luxuries. The right of one charged with crime to counsel may not be deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials in some countries, but it is in ours. From the very beginning, our state and national constitutions and laws have laid great emphasis on procedural and substantive safeguards designed to assure fair trials before impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before the law. This noble ideal cannot be realized if the poor man charged with crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer to assist him. A defendant's need for a lawyer is nowhere better stated than in the moving words of Mr. Justice Sutherland in Powell v. Alabama:\" <br>" +

If charged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself whether the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of evidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a proper charge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence irrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and knowledge adequately to prepare his defense, even though he have a perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him. Without it, though he be not guilty, he faces the danger of conviction because he does not know how to establish his innocence.\" "),

After the arrest on March 13th, 1963, Miranda was subjected to two hours of police interrogation during which time, he was never advised of his right to counsel or his right to remain silent.  During the police interrogation, Miranda confessed to the charge of rape and subsequently was asked to write out the confession on a form provided by the police.

At Miranda's trial, he was represented by Alvin Moore, a court appointed attorney, who objected to the signed confession and argued that the confession was not obtained voluntarily and should be excluded.  Moore's objection to the confession was overruled and based on the confession and the other circumstantial evidence, Miranda was found guilty of rape and kidnapping and sentenced to 20 to 30 years for each charge.  Moore appealed Miranda's case to the Arizona Supreme Court where the court affirmed the lower court's ruling.

                    "(f) Where an interrogation is conducted without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy burden rests on the Government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel. P. 475. <br>" +

Prior statutes in the American colonies, such as the Maryland Tolerance Act of 1649, mandated one accpted religion.  The Act provided limited religious tolerance to Trinitarian Christians and levied the punishment of death to any who “blaspheme God, that is Curse him, or deny our Saviour Jesus Christ” or “utter any reproachfull Speeches, words or language concerning the said Holy Trinity”.  The prohibition of a religious requirement for public office that appears in Article 6 of the Constitution and the concept of freedom of religion found in the 1st Amendment to the constitution were influenced by the Virginia Statute For Religious Freedom."),
